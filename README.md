# Build-a-Full-Shiny-Dashboard-With-shiny.fluent

With Appsilon’s recent public launch of two new R packages – shiny.fluent and shiny.react, the accessibility of React libraries to the Shiny dev community is now easier than ever. shiny.react opens up the rich React ecosystem (e.g., frameworks, blueprints, and components for charts and maps) to R developers, creating the opportunity to improve development speed, app functionality and design. The ability to port entire React UI libraries is now possible through shiny.react.

For professional, elegant designs consistent with enterprise-grade applications shiny.fluent joins the efficiency of Microsoft’s Fluent UI and R’s advanced data handling capabilities.  With a significant set of components allowing for unique functions like the ‘People Picker‘, ‘Teaching Bubble‘, and ‘Hover Card‘, and support for powerful functions like Stack(), users can be flexible with component placements in the dashboard. Through shiny.react, shiny.fluent makes it possible for the R community to access the power of React JavaScript library and Microsoft’s Fluent UI.
